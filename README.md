The baytrends package was developed to enable users to evaluate
long-term trends in the Chesapeake Bay using a Generalized Additive
Modeling (GAM) approach. The model development includes selecting a GAM
structure to describe nonlinear seasonally-varying changes over time,
incorporation of hydrologic variability via either a river flow or
salinity, the use of an intervention to deal with method or laboratory
changes suspected to impact data values, and representation of left- and
interval-censored data. This approach, which is fully transferable to
other systems, allows for Chesapeake Bay water quality data to be
evaluated in a statistically rigorous, yet flexible way to provide
insights to a range of management- and research-focused questions.

## Installation

The CRAN version of baytrends from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org)
can be installed with the code below.

``` r
install.packages("baytrends")
```

In some cases not all dependent packages are available on the userâ€™s
system. In these cases installing all dependencies is necessary.

``` r
install.packages("baytrends", dependencies = TRUE)
```

The development version (with vignettes) from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) can be installed with the code example
below using the `remotes` package.

``` r
if(!require(remotes)){install.packages("remotes")}  #install if needed
install_github("tetratech/baytrends", force = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
