\description{
Load and clean one sheet from an Excel file
}
\details{
This function reads in a single sheet from an Excel file using
  readxl::read_excel to load the data

  After reading data in with readxl::read_excel, some specific additional
  steps are implemented:

  1. Double quotes are removed from beginning and ending of all
  fields. The purpose is to maintaion leading zeroes (e.g., USGS flow gages).
  To effectively use this functionality, data maintained in a spreadsheet
  would be enclosed in quotes (e.g., "01578310"). If exported to csv or txt
  files the field would be in triple quotes (e.g., """01578310"""). Any
  column read in as integer is converted to numeric.

  2. Rows and columns with no data (i.e., all NA) are deleted unless default
  settings for remNAcol and remNArow are changed to FALSE.

  3. Completely duplicate rows are deleted unless default setting for remDup
  is changed to FALSE.

  4. If a primary key (either single or multiple columns) is selected, the
  function enforces the primary key by deleting duplicate entries based on
  the primary key. Columns corresponding to the primary key (when specified)
  are moved to the first columns.

  5. If convDates is a vector (i.e., \code{c('beginDate', 'endDate')}), then
  a date conversion to \code{as.POSIXct} is attempted for the corresponding
  columns found in the input file. If TRUE, then a date conversion is
  attempted for all columns found in the input file with 'date' in the name,
  If FALSE, no date conversion is attempted.

  Some other common time zones include the following: America/New_York,
  America/Chicago, America/Denver, America/Los_Angeles, America/Anchorage,
  America/Honolulu, America/Jamaica, America/Managua, America/Phoenix,
  America/Metlakatla

  A brief table reporting the results of the import are printed.

  Note that columns containing just F, T, FALSE, TRUE are stored as logical fields
